\title{Format factors as `X (X\%)` instead of `X\% (X)`}
\usage{
\method{format_statistics}{statistics_factor}(x, factorformat = "{N} ({percent}\%)", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a `statistics_factor` object as created by `atable:::statistics.factor`}

\item{factorformat}{how to format the values}

\item{...}{passed to/from other methods}
}
\description{
Almost an exact copy of the equivilent function from `atable`,
this function just formats factors as e.g. 15 (25%) rather than
25% (15) as `atable` does. It is a personal-preference thing...
}
\details{
When `atableExtra` loads, this function automatically overrides the `atable` version


Option `factorformat` uses the `glue` package to create strings.
Although `glue` parses the values within the braces (`{` and `}`), this is not permitted
in this case as only strings are passed to `glue`. Values that can be used in
the are braces are `N`, `total` and `percent`.
