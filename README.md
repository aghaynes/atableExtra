# atableExtra

`atable` is a package simplifying the task of creating tables of summary
statistics similar to those found as the first table of a clinical trial
publication. Although it is very flexible, utilising this flexibility
involves writing new functions to calculate other measures and
statistics. `atableExtra` provides some additional functions to simplify
this task. `atableExtra` also changes some `atable` default settings.
